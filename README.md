##Goal of this project:  
The purpose of this project is to provide a user-friendly application program interface for Woodys Automotive. We built a full-stack application with Angular JS, Node JS and xampp for database generation. To hold our data, we constructed 5 database tables for Appointment, Employee details, location details, login details, vehicle details. 
 
##Problem Faced & Outcomes:  
•	We were unable to build the payment portal utilizing credit cards due to technical difficulties and hence eliminated it.  
•	We ran into problems when we lost connections between our project's code and the database, resulting in incorrect and, in some cases, no output at all.
